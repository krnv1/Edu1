Maven  project is created as the very first step of writing the source code

It is prepared by the developer and given to devops engineer

Maven project consists of :
> src/main/java =========== Here Developrs will write the source code
  > source code - java
> src/main/resources ====== Here Developers will mainatain resource document utilities
> src/test/java =========== Test cases will be written here
  > unit test
  > functional test cases
> src/test/resources ====== Here test resources like Test Data and Excel sheets will be placed

> pom.xml (project object module) -- Every Maven project will create a pom.xml file. If this file is not prsent, the project will not work
  > dependencies == tools or s/w needed for developers to write the code and test code
  > plugins == names and version of plugins needed to build and review the code and test cases
  
Repositories : Location where dependencies and plugins are stored and Maven will fetch them to complete the build process
        > Central Repository
        > Local Repository
